# mason

A new Flutter project with `mason`.

Note:
The `login` feature was altered and I created the `LoginFAB` to add functionality to the `LoginScreen`.
I created additional tests to cover the new functionality.

The `signup` feature was created from scratch using `mason`. The reason that I didn't change anything is for you to see the default code generated by `mason`.

## Getting Started

- [ ] 1. Run the `mason_cli` command:

    ```bash
    dart pub global activate mason_cli
    ```

- [ ] 2. Run the `mason` init command:

    ```bash
    mason init
    ```

- [ ] 3. Run the `mason` install command:

    ```bash
    mason add feature_brick
    ```

- [ ] 4. use the `Makefile` I created like:

    ```bash
    make create_feature_brick name=login
    ```

- [ ] 5. List the `lib/features` directory and see the newly created feature:

    ```bash
    ls lib/features
    ```

- [ ] 6. Add `flutter_riverpod` dependency to `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```bash
    flutter pub add flutter_riverpod
    ```

    You will get an error saying:

    ```text
    The imported package 'riverpod' isn't a dependency of the importing package lib/features/login/provider/login_provider.dart:1:8 depend_on_referenced_packages
    ```

    Change the import to:

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
    ``` 

    and you're done!
